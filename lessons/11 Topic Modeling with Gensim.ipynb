    "Topic Modeling with Gensim\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a technique, developed in the last few years and used increasingly heavily in recommendation engines, to analyze a text or a corpus of texts to find clusters of words that go together more often than average. In the study of literature, topic modeling is used to gain some automated insight into what the text(s) are about, without necessarily having to read them. In fact the potential of topic modeling is a subject that is still under deep discussion within the literary branches of digital humanities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is [a useful introduction on the subject](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/) that \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see roughly how it works today, using a Python library called `gensim`. There is a reasonably good tutorial to using gensim [available here](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tutorial.html), although the tutorial makes no assumptions about your purpose in analyzing texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to, be sure to run\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install gensim\n",
    "    \n",
    "either from the command line, or prefixed with a `!` character in IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll grab the Gutenberg corpus texts from NLTK to try the tool on. As a reminder, here is what they contain:"

What that warning message was telling us is that we didn't give the algorithm enough time - that is, enough passes through the data - to let the topic buckets get to a steady state. So the first thing we can do is take its advice, and increase the number of passes that the algorithm gets to take."
