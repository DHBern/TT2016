Dear Duke of Westminster
Good speech to your noble effort in favour of District Nurses for town "L Country"; and in Commemoration of our Queen who cares for all.
We look upon the District Nurse, if she is what she should be, & if we give her the training she should have, as the Great civilizer of the [Jasor] training as well as nursing them out of ill health into good health (Health Missioners), out of drink into self control but all without preaching, without patronizing - as friends in sympathy.
But let them hold the standard high as Nurses.
Pray be sure I will try to help all I can, [the] that be small, here I will with your leave let you know.
Pray believe me your Graces faithful Servant
Florence Nightingale
