Saturday [Nov 4, 1916]
Good morning - The sun is again shining - A
continuation of the perfect weather - I'm
about to go to the doctor. I think he'll find
my "livable" at last "under control". - There is no
school to-day. - So I'm at home later than on
other week days. - The hight was fair. - I had
a walk with Marni before going to bed. - He's
always big + fine. - One of the few real time
ones - all the way through - always. - Every
moment - every breath of him - time. -
And that's really all that means anything to me.
But as I've always claimed all forces ??
me - large + small - positive + negative -
+ everything can be seen as a force - for it
is one - even shine + foolness - all
in the viewpoint - In the reaction. -
I'm out of paper. -
