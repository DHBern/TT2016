Executive Mansion
Washington Nov. 21.1864
To Mrs Bixly, Boston, Mass,
Dear Madam.
I have been shown on the files
of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts that you are the motherof
five sons who have died gloriously onthe field battles
I feel how weak and fruitlessmust be any word of
mine which should attempt to bequite you from the 
grief of a lost so overwhelming But I cannot refrain
from tendering you the consolation that may be found
in the thanks of the republic they died to save I
pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the onguish
of your Bereavement, and leave you only the chershed
memory of the loved and lost, amd the solemn pride
that must be yours to hover laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom
Yours very sincerely and respectfully
A. Lincoln
