Executive Mansion
Washington, Nov 21, 1864
To Miss Bixley, Boston, Mass,
Dear Madam.
I have been shown in the files
of the New Department a statement of the Adjutant
General of MAssachusetts that you are the mother of
five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battles
I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of
mine which should attempt to beguile you from the
grief of a loss so overwhelming But I cannot refrain
from tendring you the consolitation that may be found
in the thanks of the republic they died to save I
pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish
of your beneavement, and leave you only the chershed
memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride
that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom
Yours very sincerely and respectfully
A. Lincoln
